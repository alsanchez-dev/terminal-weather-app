# terminal-weather-app
This is a nice and simple weather app built with nodeJS for the terminal

Super simple to use for those of us who live in the terminal.

To install: 

- clone the repo to your local machine

- run npm install to load all the dependencies from package.json

- To fetch the weather all you need to do is node app -a "address"

NOTE: address is the string for the location, example: 

node app -a "Costa Rica"
